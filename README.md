# Aquarium Bot
A RPi powered device to monitor my friend's aquarium

I wanted to make a temperature monitor for my friend's aquarium that will allow her to receive daily updates and warnings if the temperature. So I did. The twitter account can be found [here](https://twitter.com/Soup19007731). Unfortunately, the new Stevens Media wifi setup will not recognize Pi Zeros (sad!) so it is currently out of commission, thus the inactive account.

Using the Twitter API, a Raspberry Pi, and a temperature sensor, the Aquarium Bot sends a daily tweet with a graph that shows the temperature changes over 24 hours. It will also send an SOS tweet if the tank temperature is too low or too high. More information can be found [here](https://mceldoon.wixsite.com/juliem/copy-of-poem-box-2).
